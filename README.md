# Courses
For some of the courses I've taken either from school or MOOCs from Coursera there have been assignments, lab reports, projects, etc. I upload everything I've done, and people can use as a reference to compare or if people are interested about different courses. I believe everyone is responsible for their own education, copying doesn't further your development in any way and so long-term it'll do more damage than good. With that said sometimes the assignments can be unclear or you get stuck for too long, and then it could be useful.
